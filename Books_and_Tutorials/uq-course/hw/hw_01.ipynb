    "1. This exercise demonstrates the probability theory is actually an extension of logic. Assume that you know that \"A implies B\". That is, your prior information is:\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   I = \\{A\\implies B\\}.\n",
    "   $$\n",
    "   Show that:\n",
    "     1. $p(AB|I) = p(A|I)$ (use common sense).\n",
    "     2. If $p(A|I) = 1$, then $p(B|I) = 1$.\n",
    "     3. If $p(B|I) = 0$, then $p(A|I) = 0$.\n",
    "     4. B and C show that probability theory is consistent with Aristotelian logic. Now, you will discover how it extends it. Show that if B is true, then A becomes more plausible, i.e.\n",

    "     5. Give at least two examples of D that apply to various scientific fields. To get you started, here are two examples:\n",
    "       1. A: It is raining. B: There are clouds in the sky. Clearly, $A\\implies B$. D tells us that if there are clouds in the sky, raining becomes more plausible.\n",
    "       2. A: General  relativity. B: Light is deflected in the presence of massive bodies. Here $A\\implies B$. Observing that B is true makes A more plausible.\n",

Do D and F contradict Karl Popper's *principle of falsification*, \"A theory in the empirical sciences can never be proven, but it can be falsified, meaning that it can and should be scrutinized by decisive experiments.\" Source: [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Karl_Popper))\n",

    "    1. Compute the probability that a patient that tested negative has tuberculosis. Does the test change our prior state of knowledge about about the patient?\n",
    "    2. What would a good test look like? Find values for $p(A|B,I) = p(\\mbox{test is positive}|\\mbox{has tuberculosis},I)$ and $p(A|\\neg B, I) = p(\\mbox{test is positive}|\\mbox{does not have tuberculosis}, I)$, so that $p(B|A,I) = p(\\mbox{has tuberculosis}|\\mbox{test is positive},I) = 0.99$. There are more than one solutions. How would you pick a good one? Thinking in this way can help you set goals if you work in R&D. If you have time, try to figure out whether or not there exists such an accurate test for tuberculosis.\n",

Therefore, you have to model $\\theta$ as a random variable and assign a probability density to it. Since $\\theta$ takes values between 0 and 1, you decide to assign a Beta distribution to it.

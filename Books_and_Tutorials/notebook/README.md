SheffieldML Notebook Repository
========

This repository contains a collection of Jupyter notebooks that can be used for demonstrating our software.

We have split the notebooks into groups.

[Background](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/background/index.ipynb) Some background maths for understanding Gaussian processes will appear here.

[Computational Biology Notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/compbio/index.ipynb) Give some examples of work completed in different projects and implemented in GPy. 

[GPy Tutorial Notebooks](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/GPy/index.ipynb) These notebooks give short tutorials on various features of GPy.

[Lab Classes](http://nbviewer.ipython.org/github/SheffieldML/notebook/blob/master/lab_classes/index.ipynb) Gives a summary of notebooks that have been used in lab classes for teaching using our software. They include notebooks for undergraduate, postgraduate and summer school courses on Gaussian processes and machine learning.

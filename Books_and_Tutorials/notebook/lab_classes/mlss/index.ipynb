      "Welcome to the lab for the Gaussian process section at the Machine Learning Summer School in Sydney.\n",

      "This notebook provides you with the guide to your lab classes for Gaussian processes. The lab classes are intended to help get you familiar with modeling with Gaussian processes as\n",
      "\n",
      "The lab classes are based on our two software packages, `pods` which is used for access to datasets and `GPy` (release 21st November 2014) for Gaussian processes. You can install the GPy framework with\n",

      "Before you start, if you aren't familiar with probabilistic processes, the following lab classes from the GPRS schools might be useful. The first session will allow you to become familiar with the Jupyter (the ipython notebook) and start to work with Gaussian processes.\n",

      "* [GPy: Introduction through Covariance Functions](./GPy introduction covariance functions.ipynb) `GPy` is a Python Gaussian process framework that implements many of the ideas we'll see in the course. In this session we introduce its covariance functions and sample from the associated Gaussian processes.\n",

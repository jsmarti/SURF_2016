\section{Task 1}
Regarding the summer research project \textit{Design Optimization of a Stochastic Multi-Objective Problem}, 10 references were found that are related, the following numbered citations correspond to the full citation for all the references:\\

\bibliography{SURF_2016}

\subsection{Questions}
\subsubsection{Reference 1}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The first reference is a book and its full citation is: M. Seeger, Gaussian processes for machine learning., vol. 14. 2004-
	\item This book was a mentor recommendation.
	\item For the purpose of the project, the problem of optimization under uncertainty is addressed by a Bayesian interpretation of Gaussian processes and the use of Gaussian process regressions to build a probabilistic surrogate of the map between the design variables and the objective in the optimization problem. This book contains the theory about Gaussian process regressions applied to machine learning techniques and provides some of the mathematic background needed for the project.
	\item The book is used as an important theoretical and mathematical reference for the concepts implemented in the project, because of this, a disussion about findings is not applicable.
	\item The book is used as an important theoretical and mathematical reference for the concepts implemented in the project, because of this, a discussion about limitations is not applicable.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reference 2}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item The second reference is an article and its full citation is: P. G. Constantine, E. Dow, and Q. Wang, “Active subspace methods in theory and practice: Applications to Kriging surfaces,” vol. 36, no. 4, pp. 1500–1524, 2014.
	\item This article was a mentor recommendation
	\item

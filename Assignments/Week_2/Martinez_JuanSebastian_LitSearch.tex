\subsection{Questions}

\subsubsection{Reference 1}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reference \cite{Huang2009} is an article and its full citation is: V. L. Huang, S. Z. Zhao, R. Mallipeddi, and P. N. Suganthan, “Multi-Objective Optimization Using Self-Adaptive Differential Evolution Algorithm,” 2009 IEEE Congress on Evolutionary Computation (CEC’2009), pp. 190–194, 2009.
	\item To find this reference, the Purdue Libraries Tool was used and it was found on the IEEE Xplore database.
	\item In this article, an objective-wise multi-objective self-adapting differential evolution method is developed to solve multi-objective optimization problems. This is relevant to the project in the sense that it describes a method to solve 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Reference 2}
\begin{enumerate}
	\item Reference  \cite{Seeger2004} is a book and its full citation is: M. Seeger, Gaussian processes for machine learning., vol. 14. 2004.
	\item This book was a mentor recommendation.
	\item For the purpose of the project, the problem of optimization under uncertainty is addressed by a Bayesian interpretation of Gaussian processes and the use of Gaussian process regressions to build a probabilistic surrogate of the map between the design variables and the objective in the optimization problem. This book contains the theory about Gaussian process regressions applied to machine learning techniques and provides some of the mathematic background needed for the project.
	\item The book is used as an important theoretical and mathematical reference for the concepts implemented in the project, because of this, a disussion about findings is not applicable.
	\item The book is used as an important theoretical and mathematical reference for the concepts implemented in the project, because of this, a discussion about limitations is not applicable.

\section{Meeting Questions and Discussion Items}


\subsection{Research Progress and Major Difficulties}

The progress of the research is accurate with the initial planning and the schedule is being followed correctly. We have made progress in the theoretical background of the research and the tool creation will start this week. Up to this point, no major difficulties have been encountered and the only artifact required to continue our work is the Python source code to be used in the tool, this code was provided recently by my mentors and we can continue making progress.

\subsection{Communication and Documentation of Research Progress}

Up to this point, documentation and communication of the research has been made through an IPython notebook. This mechanism has been successful and no changes were suggested.

\subsection{Meetings with Mentors}

Up to this point, two meetings were held every week where we discussed progress on the research and its theoretical background. These meetings have been very useful and because of this, a good understanding of the project has been accomplished.

\subsection{Career Goals Discussion}

For my future, I plan to attend graduate school and follow an academic career. With this purpose in mind, my mentors suggested me to start looking for research areas and Professors I woul like to work with. They told me that rather focusing on finding a famous school or a school with a big reputation, I should focus on looking for an advisor that works on research areas that I want. This was said because, in general, Universities have a very good quality, so the biggest criteria to make the decission is the Professor to work with and the research areas he or she focuses on.

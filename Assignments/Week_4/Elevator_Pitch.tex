\section{Elevator Pitch}
The project \textit{Design optimization of a stochastic multi-objective problem} aims to develop a stochastic method to solve multi-objective optimization problems, where the goal is to find a set of inputs that optimize a set of functions. The project focuses on three problems: A black box system where the physics of the process are not well known (we don't have an analytical expression for the system); limited observations and uncertainty in the variables; and expensive evaluations of the objective functions (expensive simulation codes or expensive experiments). For this project, we will be building a Rappture tool where scientists and experimenters can state the observations of their experiments, and the method will output the set of experiments to perform that optimizes their output, in order for them to avoid unnecessary expensive experiments.

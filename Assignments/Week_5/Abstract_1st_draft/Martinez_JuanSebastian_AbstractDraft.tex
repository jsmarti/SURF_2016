{\large \textbf{ABSTRACT}\\}
{\normalsize \textcolor{ForestGreen}{Optimization under uncertainty of multi-objective systems is a common goal in many engineering and science problems, where the values of input variables that maximize or minimize multiple outputs need to be found. }\textcolor{red}{Optimization processes are often tied to epistemic uncertainty (lack of knowledge due to limited data), as the systems to be analyzed correspond to expensive experiments or code simulations that can only be performed a limited number of times, moreover, the physics that describe the systems are not well known and a deterministic approach cannot be taken.}\textcolor{Purple}{Methods} - \textcolor{TealBlue}{Key Results} - Conclusions .\\}

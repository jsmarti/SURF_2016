    <h1>Initial Observations</h1>
    <p>In this step, enter the initial observations of the system you wish to evaluate in the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
		<li><b>Observed Inputs</b> and <b>Observed Outputs</b>: Upload your observations in the upper loader menu. Upload observed inputs and outputs from CSV files into the designated fields respectively. </li>
		<li><b>Lower Input Bounds</b> and <b>Upper Input Bounds</b>: Turn on the <b>Input Bounds</b> toggle control and enter the lower and upper bounds of the inputs in a tuple form (e.g. "0,0" and 1,1" for 2 variables, both with the lower bound of zero and the upper bound of one). Also, you may opt to set the toggle control to "off" and upload a set of desired designs of your experiment in a CSV file in the upper loader menu, along with your observations.</li>
		<li><b>Number of Iterations</b>: Enter the maximum number of iterations for the program</li>
		<li><b>See the user manual to get information related to the data upload and the correct CSV file formatting.</b></li>
    </ul>
    <p>After entering all inputs, proceed to the next step.</p>

    <h1>Initial Observations</h1>
    <p>In this step, enter the initial observations of your system in the following fields:</p>
    <ul>
		<li><b>Observed Inputs</b> and <b>Observed Outputs</b>: Upload your observations in the upper loader menu. Upload one CSV file for observed inputs and one CSV file for observed outputs. Search the wiki page for information about the correct CSV file formatting</li>
		<li><b>Lower Input Bounds</b> and <b>Upper Input Bounds</b>: Turn on the <b>Input Bounds</b> control and enter the lower and upper bounds of the inputs in a tuple form (e.g. "0,0" and 1,1" for 2 variables, both with a lower bound of 0 and an upper bound of 1). Also, turn off the control and upload a set of initial designs of your experiment in a CSV file in the upper loader menu, along with your observations. Search the wiki page for information about the correct CSV file formatting</li>
		<li><b>Number of Iterations</b>: Enter the maximum number of iterations for the program</li>
    </ul>
    <p>After entering all inputs, proceed to the next step</p>

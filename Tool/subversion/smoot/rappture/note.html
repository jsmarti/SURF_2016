    <h1>SMOOT</h1>
    <p> Welcome to SMOOT, the Stochastic Multi-Objective Optimization Tool. This application will help you perform optimization over your system <i>f</i>, with some given observations of inputs <i>x</i> and outputs <i>y</i> as shown:</p>

    <p>The tool is designed to work through 2 single steps: an initial phase to input initial observations; and a second phase to iteratively input new results from the suggested experiments of the code.</p>
    <p>At the beginning, inital observations are given to the tool and the simulation will propose a new experiment to perform, all of this as a result of the optimization process.
    After gathering the new results, they should also be given to the tool to perform a new simulation and 
    the tool will propose a new experiment. This process is described in the following diagram.</p>

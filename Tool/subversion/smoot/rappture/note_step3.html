    <h1>Optimization Process</h1>
    <p>The iterative process of optimization is controlled by the inputs:</p>
    <ul>
		<li><b>Finish Executions</b>: Set a value of "yes" and simulate to terminate the program</li>
		<li><b>New Observed Value</b>: Enter a new result of your experiment in a tuple form or upload a CSV file</li>
    </ul>	
    <p>If you are running the tool for the first time, the <b>New Observed Value</b> input can be blank or have any value. After the first simulation is performed, the program will suggest a new design for your experiment. 
    The result of the suggested experiment should be entered in the <b>New Observed Value</b> field for a new simulation. This process should continue until the maximum number of iterations is reached, the proposed designs are completely evaluated, or until 
    the <b>Finish Executions</b> control is activated.</p>
